# Snake_Game

## A Simple C++ Game Created using Glut library

##### This is similar to the snake game on old nokia mobile phones but it is written for linux.

###### This was my first C++ project using simple loops and global variables.

###### The Graphics Headers are not Created by me, rather they were given as a template.

###### Known Bugs:
1. Snake sometimes eat food and sometimes it doesnot.
2. Snake doesnot die after hitting the obstacle after the first time obstacle changes its position.

*These Bugs are due to odd pixel sizes of food and snake*

To Compile:-
1. Install Required libraries using 'bash install-libraries.sh'
2. Compile everything by typing 'make'. (You should have make installed for this)

To Run:-

*Type ./game-release*
